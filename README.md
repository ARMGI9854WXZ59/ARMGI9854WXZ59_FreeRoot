# ARMGI9854WXZ59 Specials M9Pseudo Root Access Installer

## Overview

This shell script is just my experiment to get Root access or simulate Root access in a System where sudo or root is not accessible by the user. I always thought about making something like this and now it got easier seeing a fellow tried it and published it in their repo. I'll fully modify it and maybe make another repository in my own style when I have time. Until then, I'm using this fork as a base.

This shell script is made and modified by ARMGI9854WXZ59 [ Alex Mahdi ] inspired by the Unix commands such as Fakeroot, Proot, Chroot, Unix Root Shell and other similar Software and tools and currently takes a base from the direct fork of Foxytoux installer which is designed to automate the installation of Foxytoux, a lightweight Ubuntu environment using Proot.

## Changes from the FoxyToux script

Using the official PRoot binary files instead of the ones from the source repositories.

Modified to install an ultra-minimal System based on BlackArch Linux made and modified by ARMGI9854WXZ59 [ Alex Mahdi ] for personal use and experiment.
